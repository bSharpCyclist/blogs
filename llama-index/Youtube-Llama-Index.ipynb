    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A few months ago I published an article showcasing how one could use [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) to summarize YouTube videos based on transcripts. LlamaIndex has changed a lot since then, and many of the links in that previous article are now dead, along with non functional code. Things change so quickly today, very hard to keep up! Nevertheless, I thought it would be fun to create a new project which uses the updated API. Note, at the time of this writing I'm using llama-index version 0.8.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The areas that will be covered in this short article are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* YouTube transcript downloader\n",
    "* Loading transcripts and creating a VectorStore index\n",
    "* Persist index to disk and reload\n",
    "* Query index and examine nodes/chunks used by LLM\n",
    "* Using similarity_top_k to change the number of nodes/chunks sent to LLM\n",
    "* Using Llama-Index debugging to examine events\n",
    "* Refreshing an index with new documents\n",
    "* Using Jupyter-to-Medium to publish notebook to Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "Llama-Index has many different index structures that can be used, but this article will only be using the VectorStore index. Future articles will take a deeper dive into the different index structures and how to use them. Additionally, I also want to take a look at using local resources for embedding and response generation, as opposed to using OpenAI. \n",
    "\n",
    "## YouTube Transcript Downloader\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving into the details of LlamaIndex, I'll post the code that I use to download transcripts from YouTube playlists. Once again, I'll use the Ancient Aliens playlist for my corpus of data to play with. UAPs and extraterrestrial biologics are quite an interesting topic these days. But if that doesn't suit you, then feel free to change the playlist ID and follow along with whatever topic/playlist that interests you!\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before in the previous article, you will need to obtain a YouTube Data API key. The one major change I made to the script since last time was to only download new transcripts in the playlist that aren't already present in my local directory. I do this by sorting the videos by publish date, descending, and once I encounter a transcript I already have I then stop."

    "## LlamaIndex\n",
    "\n",
    "The LlamaIndex [documentation](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) has also changed quite a bit since I last used the project back in March. I highly recommend reading through the information a bit and getting a feel for what it can do. A good place to start would be the Basic Usage Pattern tutorial. It's pretty easy to get up and running quickly. You can read in the transcripts or whatever text you have, create an index, and then execute a query in just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another great resource for learning LlamaIndex is their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/eN6D2HQ4aX) server. It's very active and there are many people there that can help you out. Additionally, they have a chat bot that will answer your questions about how to use the API. It's amazing how well it works. I've learned so much about the API by just playing with some code and asking the chatbot questions. A lot faster than reading through the documentation, but there will be times that you'll want to go through it in more detail. The chatbot does a great job of pointing you in the right direction, and you can go from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Read Data and Create Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through the code below. The process begins by reading in the transcript text files using SimpleDirectoryReader. While doing so the filename gets added as metadata with a key of 'episode_title'. This is to help bias the search later based on episode title. Additionally, a flag is passed to indicate the filename should be used as the ID for the Document. This will come in handy later when refreshing the index based on new transcripts that are downloaded. Finally, each document in the collection is tagged such that the meta data isn't passed to the LLM, as it doesn't necessarily need to read that when generating a response. Again, the metadata is being used to help find the chunks of data to pass to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next an LLM object is created using the gpt-4 model. Note, the default text generation model, if not specified, is gpt-3.5-turbo, and for creating the embeddings it is text-embedding-ada-002. When creating the LLM object, max tokens is set to 1024. This indicates the maximum length of the response we should get from the LLM. For gpt-4, the maximum number of tokens is 8192, and this includes both the input and output. More on that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ServiceContext object is then created, which is used during the indexing and querying stage in a LlamaIndex pipeline/application. Chunk_size is set to 1024 tokens, which indicates the size of the chunks that the transcript text data should be broken up into. And then finally, a VectorStoreIndex is created and saved to disk. Llama-Index has many types of indexes that can be used and will be dictated by the use case. Again, I hope to explore them more in future articles."

    "This article was originally written as a Jupyter notebook in VSCode. I then used the [jupyter-to-medium](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-to-medium/) library to push the notebook directly to Medium. There is some setup involved, e.g., obtaining a Medium integration token (see link). But once you have that, you can than push the notebook to Medium directly from the command line in a terminal. Note, the below command line syntax didn't work for me.\n",
